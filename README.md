# Decision-Trees-for-iris-dataset and XOR Gate

The above file contains the working code for decision Tree from scratch on iris dataset and XOR gate.Following two files conatains the vizualization
of those trees. Vizualization has been created using python pydtplus and graphviz module.
Also a vizualtion has been provided by printing steps for tree creation using python.
Gain ratio has been used as a splitting metric.

Iris dataset can be imported from sklearn datasets.
